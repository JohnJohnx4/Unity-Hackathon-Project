# Unity-Hackathon-Project

## 1st Person Endless Shooter

### Minimum Viable Product:
1. Player Controller
2. Bad Guys (Zombies)
3. Island w/ woods and city.
4. Several Weapons to choose from.
5. Destructible Environment.
6. Basic UI

### What we actually have:
1. Player Controller works great except Alex broke the jump mechanism right before build time.
2. Lots of bad guys.. 
3. Island, city and a few destructable trees.
4. We were only able to get the Assault Rifle and Flamethrower done in time.
5. You can set the trees and zombies on fire with your flamethrower.
6. Basic UI is up and it tracks player health; however we ran out of time, so ammo was never added.
